Basic measurement units:
========================
- 1 meter = <**39.370**> inches 
- 1 mile = <**5280**> feet 
- 1 mile = <**1609**> meters
- Circumference of the Earth = <**24,901**> miles 

Basic terminology
=================
* `yotta` something = <**100000000000000000000000**> times something 
* `kilo` something = <**1000**> times something
* <**hecto**> something = 100 times something
* <**deca**> something = 10 times something
* `milli` something = 1/<**1000**> of something
* `micro` something = 1/<**1000000**> of something
* `nano` something = 1/<**1000000000**> of something
* <**pico**>something = 1/1000000000000 of something

From Physics
============
* = <**186,282**> mps (miles per second)
* = <**299,792**> kps (kilometers per second)

Speed of Electronic Signals
===========================
* In one nanosecond = <**11.80282752**> inches (299,792/0.039370/1000000000)
* In one microsecond = <**983.56896**> feet (0.007614732029/12*1000)
* In one millisecond = <**186.282**> miles  (186282/1000)
* In one second = <**186282**> miles
* In one second = <**7.48**> times around the Earth!

World of Processors:Haswell GT2 4C chip
=======================================
* Manufacturing Process = <**22**>nm
* Transistor Count = <**1.4B**> transistors
* Die Size: <**177**>mm^2

Assuming that the chip is square, and that there are 1,400,000,000 transistors
on the chip, we can take the square-root of 1.4 billion to see how many
transistors must be on each side of the square. If the actual chip has a
surface area of 264 square millimeters, figure out how long each side is, and
using your numbers from above, figure out how long it takes for an electronic
signal to move the distance between two adjacent transistors.

    * time for a signal to move between transistors = <??> picoseconds

Counting up
***********

As a last bit of trivia, lets see how big a 64-bit integer really is.

The current Pentium processor uses 64-bit registers. Assuming your processor is
ticking away at a rate of 2.7 GHz, how long will it take to reach the biggest
number the counter can hold (it is 64-bits wide):

    * Time until the counter "rolls over" = <??> years
